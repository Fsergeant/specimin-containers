specimin-containers
===================
The assignment was to make a 'useful' object. Lucas and I worked together to make sets of specimin collection jars. 
An individual's experience of the world would be shaped by their search to fill the jars. 
Attached are the files that I designed, but the image contains jars designed by both Lucas and me.
